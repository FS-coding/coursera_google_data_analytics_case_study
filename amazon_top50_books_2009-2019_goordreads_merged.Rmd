## Introduction

This is my analysis of the data set on Amazon's Top 50 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019[^1], scrapped on October 2020. It contains 550 books, the data has been
categorized into fiction and non-fiction.

[^1]: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019>

As the data was limited in some aspects, e.g. genre, the original data
set was combined with a Goodreads Books data set[^2] to include other
specific genres, and number of pages. Other information was discarded.

[^2]: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/goodreads-books>

### Tools and methodology.

The data sets (in .csv format) were cleaned using Google's Spreadsheets,
and merged using SQL through Google's Big Query, for marching book titles. While Amazon (AMZ) data set is divided into genre vs. fiction, Goodreads books (GR)
data set includes more specific genres, raked according to users'
votes, so the main specific genre was extracted based on maximum number
of votes.

Some missing page numbers were added, by searching directly on Amazon's
website. Similarly, price 0 entries were corrected - it was assumed
price belonged to eBooks, so the printed version was chosen.

Repeated entries in the AMZ set were left, as they correspond to the
book being in the Top 50 in different years. Contrarily, duplicates in
the GR set correspond to different editions, so their values were
averaged. All column names were lower-cased. The new table was thus:

      * amazon.Name as title: Name of the book
      * amazon.Author as author: The author of the Book
      * amazon.User_Rating as amz_rating: Amazon User Rating
      * amazon.Reviews as amz_reviews: Number of written reviews on Amazon
      * Average of goodreads.average_rating as gr_rating: Goodreads Books User Rating
      * Average of goodreads.review_count as gr_reviews: Number of written reviews on Goodreads Books
      * amazon.Price as price: The price of the book (As at 13/10/2020)
      * amazon.Year as year: The Year(s) it ranked on Amazon's bestseller list
      * amazon.Genre as genre: Whether fiction or non-fiction
      * goodreads.genre as gr_genre: Specific genres, as voted by Goodreads Books Users
      * goodreads.number_of_pages as num_pages: Number of pages

### SQL Queries:

-   Deleted GR duplicates choosing genre based on max votes:

    ``` {(sql)}
    WITH trimmed_gr AS (SELECT DISTINCT title as new_title, 
    MAX(SAFE_CAST(votes as INT)) as max_votes -- Removes duplicates, choosing genre based on max votes

    FROM 
    `amazon_books.goodreads` GROUP BY title)

    SELECT
    *

    FROM 
    amazon_books.goodreads as goodreads 
    INNER JOIN trimmed_gr 
    ON goodreads.title = trimmed_gr.new_title 
    WHERE SAFE_CAST(goodreads.votes as INT) = trimmed_gr.max_votes 
    ORDER BY title
    ```

-   Data sets merged (INNER JOIN):

    ``` {(sql)}
    SELECT 
    amazon.Name as title, 
    amazon.Author as author, 
    AVG(amazon.User_Rating) as amz_rating, 
    AVG(amazon.Reviews) as amz_reviews, 
    AVG(goodreads.average_rating) as gr_rating, 
    AVG(goodreads.review_count) as gr_reviews, 
    AVG(amazon.Price) as price, 
    amazon.Year, amazon.Genre, 
    goodreads.genre, 
    AVG(SAFE_CAST(goodreads.number_of_pages as INT)) as num_pages,

    FROM 
    `amazon_books.bestsellers` as amazon 
    INNER JOIN 
    `amazon_books.goodreads_trimmed` as goodreads 
    ON amazon.Name = goodreads.title

    GROUP BY 
    amazon.Name, 
    amazon.Author, 
    amazon.Year, 
    amazon.Genre, 
    goodreads.genre

    ORDER BY 
    amazon.Name
    ```

## Analysis

```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(ggpubr)
library(Tmisc)
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r Load CSV, echo=FALSE}
amazon_goodreads_merged <- read_csv("amazon_top50_books_2009-2019_goordreads_merged - amazon-goodreads-merged.csv", 
    col_types = cols(year = col_integer(), 
        num_pages = col_integer()))
#glimpse(amazon_goodreads_merged)
```

The new (merged) data set thus contains the following columns:

```{r}
colnames(amazon_goodreads_merged)
```

### Starting questions:

-   What are the most popular books and authors for the years 2009-2019?
-   Do average user ratings vary with time, or by genre, etc?
-   Are AMZ ratings different to GR's?
-   Is there any relation between book price or number of pages and book
    rating?
-   What's the average price? Has it changed over time?

## Most popular books

### Number of times a book has been in the Top 50

```{r Most popular books table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
amazon_goodreads_merged %>%
  group_by(title, amz_reviews) %>%

  #filter(count > 2)
  head(n = 10)

```

```{r Most popular books, echo=FALSE}

  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(-count) %>% 
  head(n = 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(title, count), y=count,fill=amz_reviews)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme_minimal()+
  coord_flip()+
  scale_x_discrete(label=function(x) str_trunc(x, 30))+
  labs(title="Number of times a book has been in the Top 50",
        y ="Count", x = "Book", fill="Reviews")+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="yellow", mid="coral", high="red", midpoint=15000)
  


```

## Most popular authors

  group_by(author, genre) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(-count) %>%

author_count
```

```{r Number of years an author has been in the Top 50, divided by genre, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(author_count, aes(x=reorder(author, count), y=count,fill=genre)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  theme_minimal()+
  #theme(legend.position="top")+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title="Number of years an author has been in the Top 50, by genre",
       x = "Book", fill="Genre")

```

## Ratings

### Most common rating

```{r Most common rating, echo=FALSE}
ratings_count <- amazon_goodreads_merged %>% 
  group_by(amz_rating) %>%
  summarise(count_r = n()) %>% 
  arrange(amz_rating)

ratings_count
```

```{r Rating frequency - by genre, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(amz_rating, fill=genre)) + 
  geom_bar()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position="top")+
  labs(title="Rating frequency by genre",
        y ="Count", x = "AMZ rating", fill="Reviews")+
  theme_dark()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # centers title
  
```

### Rating by year

```{r Hea tmap of genre rating - by year, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=year, y=genre, fill= amz_rating)) + 
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="white", mid="yellow", high="red",
                       midpoint=4.3)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2009,2010,2011,2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))+
   theme_minimal()+
  labs(title=" Heatmap of genre rating by year", fill="Rating")


  
```


### Amazon ratings vs Goodreads ratings

How are books rated differently by Amazon and Goodreads users?

```{r AMZ vs GR ratings, echo=FALSE}
#erase x names
ggplot(data=amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=reorder(title, year))) + 
  geom_line(aes(y=gr_rating, group=1), color="darkturquoise", size=1.5)+
  geom_line(aes(y=amz_rating, group=1), color="darkgoldenrod1", size=1.5)+
  theme_classic()+
  ylim(0,5)+
  labs(title="AMZ rating vs GR rating compared", y="Rating", x="Books by year")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5, angle = 90))+
  scale_x_discrete(label = function(x) stringr::str_trunc(x, 12))
  
```

### AMZ vs GR ratings correlation

```{r AMZ vs GR ratings correlation table, echo=FALSE}

amazon_goodreads_merged %>% 
  summarise("Average AMZ rating" = mean(amz_rating), "Average GR rating" = mean(gr_rating), "Correlation" = cor(amz_rating, gr_rating))
```

```{r AMZ vs GR ratings correlation chart, echo=FALSE}
ggscatter(amazon_goodreads_merged, x = "amz_rating", y = "gr_rating", shape="genre",
          add = "reg.line", color="steelblue", conf.int = TRUE, 
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson")+
  labs(title="Rating correlation", y="GR rating", x="AMZ rating")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) # centers title
      
```

### Observation

While AMZ ratings are higher than the (averaged) GR ratings there's a
strong correlation between the two. For simplicity, following analysis
will be done using the original rating (AMZ).



## Prices and number of pages
### Price distribution by year

```{r Average price by year, echo=FALSE}
price_average_year <- amazon_goodreads_merged %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(Average_price=round(mean(price), digits=2)) %>%
  arrange(year)

price_average_year

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
amazon_goodreads_merged %>% 
  group_by(year, genre) %>% 
  summarise(ap=mean(price)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = ap, color = genre)) +
  geom_path(size=2)+
  labs(title="Average prices by year and genre", y="Price", x="")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2009,2010,2011,2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))+
  theme_economist()
```



```{r Price distribution by year, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=year))+
  geom_point(aes(y=price, colour=genre), size=2.5)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2009,2010,2011,2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))+
  geom_smooth(aes(y=price), size=0.5, color="limegreen")+
  theme_dark()

```

### Price vs rating relationship

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=price, y=amz_rating, color=genre)) + 
  geom_point(size=4)+
  ylim(3,5)+
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Set3")+
  labs(title="Price vs rating", y="Rating", x="Price")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ggscatter(amazon_goodreads_merged, x = "price", y = "amz_rating", 
          color="coral", size = 3, # Points color, size
          add = "reg.line", conf.int = TRUE, 
          add.params = list(color = "darkcyan", fill = "bisque2"), # Customize reg. line
          cor.coef = TRUE, cor.method = "pearson")+
  labs(title="Price vs rating correlation", y="Rating", x="Price")
```

### Price vs number of pages

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=price, y=num_pages, group=1, 
                                         color=genre)) + 
  geom_point(size=4)+
  labs(title="Price vs number of pages", y="Num. pages", x="Price", Fill="Year")
  
```

```{r Rating vs number of pages by genre, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=num_pages, colour=genre)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=amz_rating, group=1), size=3)+
  geom_smooth(aes(y=amz_rating), color="darkgoldenrod1", size=0.5)+
  ylim(3,5)+
  labs(title="Rating vs number of pages by genre", x="Number of pages", y="AMZ Rating")+
  theme_dark()
```

## Reviews

```{r, echo=FALSE}
amazon_goodreads_merged %>% 
  group_by("Year" = year) %>% 
  summarise("Sum of AMZ reviews" = sum(amz_reviews), "Sum of GR reviews" = sum(gr_reviews))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
amazon_goodreads_merged %>% 
  group_by(year, ) %>% 
  summarise(amzr=sum(amz_reviews), grr=sum(gr_reviews)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year)) +
  geom_path(aes(y = amzr, color="Amazon"), size=2)+
  geom_path(aes(y = grr, color="Goodreads"), size=2)+
    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2009,2010,2011,2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))+
  labs(title="AMZ vs GR total reviews by year", x="", y="Total reviews", color="Reviews")+
    theme_solarized()
  
```

Unlike ratings, total review numbers is very different in both sites: GR users wrote more reviews than AMZ users for the same books - at least prior to 2019. This could be explained by the fact that despite being a subsidiary of AMZ, GR is a social cataloging website and thus users are more interested in sharing their opinion. 

```{r Total reviews by genre, echo=FALSE}
amazon_goodreads_merged %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise("Sum of AMZ reviews" = sum(amz_reviews), "Sum of GR reviews" = sum(gr_reviews))



#  mutate(percentage = round(count/sum(count)*100, digits = 2))
```


```{r Total reviews per year, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=year, y=amz_reviews, fill=genre)) + 
  labs(title="Total (AMZ) reviews per year", y="Reviews", x="Year")+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  theme(legend.position="top")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2009,2010,2011,2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
  facet_wrap(~genre)+
  theme_cleveland()
```
### Observations

Total reviews for Fiction are generally higher (especially in 2014), but slowly declining - until 2019. On the other hand, non fiction reviews were very low, but rising steadily in 2015-2019.  


## Genre distribution

```{r Genre distribution %, echo=FALSE}

genre_pie <- amazon_goodreads_merged %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(count/sum(count)*100, digits = 2))

genre_pie

```

### Pie chart of total distribution by genre

```{r Pie chart of total distrubution by genre, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(genre_pie, aes(x = "", y = percentage, fill = genre)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y", start = 0)+
  theme_void()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title="Genre distribution %")+
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage,0), "%")), position = position_stack(vjust=0.5))

  
```
### Observations

55% of bestsellers belong to the general Non fiction genre. When more specific genres are added, Non fiction and fiction still remain the top categories, in that order.

In contrast, Fiction books are more reviewed, as seen above.


### Specific genre distribution %

```{r Specific genre distribution, echo=FALSE}

gr_pie <- amazon_goodreads_merged %>%
  group_by(gr_genre) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = round(count/sum(count)*100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percentage))

gr_pie

```

### Tile chart of total distribution by genre

```{r Tile chart of total distribution by genre, echo=FALSE }
ggplot(gr_pie, aes(x=count, y=gr_genre, fill= percentage)) + 
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="yellow", mid="red", high="purple",
                       midpoint=15)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title="Specific genre distribution %", x="Count", y="Specific genre")
```

### Heat map of specific genre rating, by year

```{r Heat map of specific genre rating, by year, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=year, y=gr_genre, fill= amz_rating)) + 
  geom_tile()+
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="white", mid="yellow", high="darkred",
                       midpoint=4.3)+

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+
  labs(title="Specific genre rating by year", x="Year", y="Specific genre", fill="Rating")

  
```

### Specific genre ratings by year

```{r Specific genre ratings by year, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=amazon_goodreads_merged, aes(x=year, y=amz_rating, colour=genre)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~gr_genre)+

```


```{r Total reviews by specific genre, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = amazon_goodreads_merged) + 
  stat_summary( mapping = aes(x = year, y = amz_reviews), 
                fun.min = min, fun.max = max, fun = median, color="darkorchid")+
  facet_wrap(~gr_genre)+
  labs(title="Total reviews by specific genre", x="Year", y="AMZ Reviews")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2009,2010,2011,2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019))
```

## Points for further analysis

It would be great to analyse if user ratings and purchases are affected by  format: ebook, audiobook, paperback/hardcover.

User data (age, sex), and Amazon site version (country) are also not considered here, but they would make interesting points for analysis.

Finally, it's worth considering how the Covid-19 Pandemic (2019-2022) affected sales, ratings, prices, etc.
